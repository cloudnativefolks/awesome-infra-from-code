 
Awesome Infrastructure from Code

## Introduction 
- The next evolution in infrastructure management is to derive your infrastructure directly from the application code, rather than defining it separately as code.
- Infrastructure-from-Code (IfC) analyzes your application code to automatically create and maintain the necessary cloud resources, eliminating the need for manual configuration. By inferring and exposing resources like web servers directly from the code, IfC abstracts infrastructure management, allowing companies to focus on their core services. While this new abstraction might seem daunting, it promises a significant productivity boost. Different IfC approaches share the common goal of letting service code define infrastructure needs, varying in how tightly they integrate with the code.
